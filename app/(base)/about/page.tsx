            1. Help users interact with DAOs, apps, and services by distributing
            small amounts of the tokens used in those ecosystems.

            2. Help projects in the test phase distribute their token to users.
            They can also set some bug bounties to incentivize users.
            <br />
            3. Distribute several UBI tokens in one place.
            <br />
            4. Prioritize real users over airdrop hunters by limiting the number
            of tokens one person can claim.

            Beginning users cannot effectively onboard to web3 via the current
            learn-to-earn platforms because they don’t teach users how to take
            the very first steps. We believe that almost all of the current
            learn-to-earn platforms’ users are already onboarded to web3 and
            largely complete tasks to be eligible for airdrops.

            Learn Tap can utilize Gas tap and Token Tap to help onboard new
            users to Web3 all in one place with absolutely no cost to the user.
          </p>

          <p className="about-section__text">
            Users learn how to set up a wallet first, then how to add a network,
            and then they can claim their first gas tokens from the Gas Tap.
            After that, users can claim tokens from Token Tap to learn how to
            work with Web3 projects like swapping, providing liquidity, staking,
            voting, etc. In many cases, a brand new human user can go from zero
            to being an on-chain crypto user all in one place with no cost to
            the user.

            creators have the option to gate the sale with BrightID. Also,
            instead of paying a large fee to launch pad platforms, in Launch
            Tap, every unique human will benefit from each launch through Prize

            can instead join a raffle where, if selected, they could win a much
            larger prize. A main source of prizes will be Launch Tap: 1% of each
            launch will be distributed to verified unique humans via Prize Tap.
            This will provide buzz around the launch and give Unitap users a
